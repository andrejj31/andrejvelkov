        <p>
          I'm Andrej Velkov, a passionate full stack web developer and dedicated
          computer engineering student at FINKI. I am deeply fascinated by the
          world of technology and enjoy exploring its vast possibilities. As a
          full stack web developer, I possess a wide range of skills and
          expertise in both front-end and back-end development. I am proficient
          in languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and have experience
          working with popular frameworks and libraries like React and Node.js.
          My goal is to create intuitive, user-friendly, and visually appealing
          websites and web applications that leave a lasting impression on
          users. Apart from my technical pursuits, I am an avid basketball
          enthusiast. I find joy and inspiration on the basketball court, where
          I can challenge myself physically and mentally. Basketball has taught
          me the importance of teamwork, discipline, and perseverance, which I
          apply to my personal and professional life.
